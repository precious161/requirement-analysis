# Requirment-Analysis
ðŸ“– What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of development by ensuring that the system to be built will meet the intended purpose.

ðŸ§  Key Concepts
Requirement Gathering: Collecting information from users, clients, and stakeholders to understand what the software must achieve.

Analysis and Refinement: Evaluating gathered requirements for clarity, feasibility, consistency, and completeness.

Documentation: Creating clear, structured documentation (e.g., Software Requirements Specification - SRS) to guide the design, development, and testing processes.

ðŸŽ¯ Importance in the SDLC
Foundation for Design: Requirements guide how the software is architected and developed.

Prevents Scope Creep: Clearly defined requirements help avoid feature bloat and unexpected changes.

Improves Communication: Serves as a bridge between non-technical stakeholders and technical teams.

Enables Accurate Planning: Assists with project timelines, budgeting, and resource management.

Facilitates Testing and Validation: Ensures that the product is verified against user expectations.

âœ… Outcome
The result of effective Requirement Analysis is a shared understanding of the project's scope and goals, which minimizes development errors, enhances productivity, and increases the likelihood of project success.
