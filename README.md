# Requirment-Analysis
üìñ What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of development by ensuring that the system to be built will meet the intended purpose.

üß† Key Concepts
Requirement Gathering: Collecting information from users, clients, and stakeholders to understand what the software must achieve.

Analysis and Refinement: Evaluating gathered requirements for clarity, feasibility, consistency, and completeness.

Documentation: Creating clear, structured documentation (e.g., Software Requirements Specification - SRS) to guide the design, development, and testing processes.

üéØ Importance in the SDLC
Foundation for Design: Requirements guide how the software is architected and developed.

Prevents Scope Creep: Clearly defined requirements help avoid feature bloat and unexpected changes.

Improves Communication: Serves as a bridge between non-technical stakeholders and technical teams.

Enables Accurate Planning: Assists with project timelines, budgeting, and resource management.

Facilitates Testing and Validation: Ensures that the product is verified against user expectations.

‚úÖ Outcome
The result of effective Requirement Analysis is a shared understanding of the project's scope and goals, which minimizes development errors, enhances productivity, and increases the likelihood of project success.
‚ùó Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is a foundational step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that ensures the project is built on a clear understanding of the problem it aims to solve. Its importance cannot be overstated, and here are three key reasons why:

1. ‚úÖ Clear Understanding of Project Goals
Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between clients, users, and developers by translating business needs into technical specifications. This alignment helps ensure that the final product meets user expectations and solves the right problem.

2. üß≠ Reduces Development Risks and Rework
By identifying requirements early, potential misunderstandings or gaps are addressed before development begins. This reduces costly rework, scope creep, and the risk of delivering an unusable or incomplete product.

3. üõ† Enables Better Planning and Design
A well-defined set of requirements allows for accurate project estimation‚Äîtimelines, resources, budget‚Äîand informs system architecture, design decisions, and technology stack selection. This leads to a smoother, more predictable development process.
üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis involves a series of structured activities to ensure that the software system meets the expectations of its stakeholders. Below are the five key activities involved:

‚Ä¢ Requirement Gathering
This is the initial step where information is collected from various stakeholders (clients, end-users, managers, etc.).

The goal is to understand the business needs, user goals, and system constraints.

‚Ä¢ Requirement Elicitation
Focuses on extracting detailed requirements through techniques such as interviews, surveys, observations, and workshops.

Helps uncover implicit needs, clarify vague expectations, and ensure all voices are heard.

‚Ä¢ Requirement Documentation
Converts gathered information into formal documents like the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

Ensures requirements are clearly written, organized, traceable, and accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

‚Ä¢ Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Involves reviewing and refining requirements to eliminate ambiguity, resolve conflicts, and assess feasibility.

Modeling techniques such as use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, and user stories are often used for visualization and validation.

‚Ä¢ Requirement Validation
Confirms that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs.

Involves stakeholder reviews, walkthroughs, and sometimes prototyping to verify completeness, correctness, and testability.
üßæ Types of Requirements
In software development, requirements are typically categorized into two main types: Functional Requirements and Non-functional Requirements. Both are essential to the success of a system but serve different purposes.

üîß Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define what the system should do. They describe the features, behaviors, and interactions the system must support to fulfill user needs.

üìå Examples for a Booking Management System:
Users must be able to create, update, and cancel a booking.

The system should allow administrators to view all bookings in a calendar view.

The platform should send booking confirmation and cancellation emails to users.

Registered users must be able to log in and manage their own bookings.

The system should prevent double-booking of the same resource (e.g., room, seat, service).

‚öôÔ∏è Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform. They focus on quality attributes, such as performance, security, usability, and scalability.

üìå Examples for a Booking Management System:
The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

Booking confirmation emails must be sent within 10 seconds of the action.

The user interface must be responsive and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

User data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit.

The system should have 99.9% uptime availability.

üìä Use Case Diagrams
What is a Use Case Diagram?
A Use Case Diagram is a visual modeling tool from UML (Unified Modeling Language) that captures the functional requirements of a system. It shows who (actors) interacts with the system and what they can do (use cases).

‚úÖ Benefits:
Clarifies system scope by identifying interactions

Bridges communication between stakeholders and developers

Acts as a high-level blueprint before moving into detailed design

Use Case Example for Booking Management System
Below is an illustrative use case diagram for our booking system. It includes the key actors and their main actions:

Actors:

Guest: Browses availability, makes/cancels bookings

Registered User: Logs in, manages bookings

Administrator: Oversees all bookings, manages resources, sends notifications

Use Cases:

Browse Availability

Create Booking

Update Booking

Cancel Booking

Log In / Log Out

View All Bookings (Admin)

Manage Resources (Admin)

Send Notification Emails

Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ
Objective: Establishing clear criteria for feature completion.

What is Acceptance Criteria?

Acceptance criteria are conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by the stakeholders.
How to Define Acceptance Criteria:

Be specific and measurable.
Include functional and non-functional aspects.
Example for Booking System: ‚ÄúUsers should be able to select available dates, confirm booking, and receive a confirmation email within 2 minutes.‚Äù
Benefits of Acceptance Criteria:

Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
Provide a basis for testing and validation.
Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.
