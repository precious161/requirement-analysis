# Requirment-Analysis
📋 Requirement Analysis
Before diving into development, we conducted a thorough requirement analysis to define the scope, objectives, and constraints of the project. This process ensured alignment with ALX's project goals and helped guide the architecture and implementation strategy.

✅ Objectives
Understand the functional and non-functional requirements.

Identify the target users and their needs.

Break down the project into modular, testable components.

Define data flow, system inputs/outputs, and performance expectations.

🔍 Key Steps Taken
Problem Definition: Clarified what the project aims to solve and how it fits within the ALX curriculum.

User & Use Case Analysis: Identified primary users and how they will interact with the system.

System Requirements:

Functional: Core features the system must perform.

Non-functional: Security, performance, usability, and scalability constraints.

Technology Stack Decision: Selected tools and languages based on project requirements, team skills, and ALX guidelines.

🛠 Output
The requirement analysis served as the foundation for:

System architecture design

Task breakdown and sprint planning

Development of test cases

Project documentation
